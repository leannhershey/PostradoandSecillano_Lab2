        <p>Saturday classes hit different, then we ended with a simple gala and laughs.</p>
        <p class="post-full-caption">Saturday classes hit different talaga lalo na pag minor sub😭 Mishli told me to come early this time kasi lagi raw akong late. So ayun, I actually woke up early pero tagal ko pa rin mag-asikaso? It’s like I have this special talent of waking up early but still moving in slow motion. First class was Understanding the Self, and we had this activity where we exchanged perceptions about each other. I was honestly touched with what Mishli said about me. It feels nice hearing how someone sees you in their own perspective. Parang small self-reflection moment in the middle of a sleepy Saturday. We still had an afternoon class, so we stayed inside our room during lunch. Successful ang Ulam of the Day (UOTD): lumpia, sitaw, and adobo na topic pa last night sa gc. We even invited Ma’am to join us and she treated us with ice cream with a twist, isa-isa kaming tinawag sa recitation😭 HAHWHAHHAH. After class, gumala kami because of course, we need content for the blog✌🏻😝. Simple gala, random kwentuhan, and laughs, but it made the day better. Not bad for a Saturday I almost complained about. Can't wait for our next salo-salo.</p>

        <p>A blessed Sunday indeed.</p>
        <p class="post-full-caption">We started early, like early early, traveling to Bacacay to attend Mass and mag-preach house-to-house. Since hindi na masyadong nakakapagsimba ang ibang tao, the Parish Priest asked help from us youth to reach out. So ayun, mission mode kami today. Sabay-sabay kaming pumunta dun, then we decided to pair up para mas mapuntahan lahat ng bahay. We shared and witnessed how God worked in our lives, and asked them also how they encounter God's love. May iba na hindi nagpatuloy, but still, I believe they are blessed. Walang exemption sa pagmamahal ni Lord. 🤍 I also met new friends along the way. Nakakapagod, but it was so fun and heartwarming at the same time. There’s something different talaga when you serve with the right people. In the afternoon, we had our monthly Youth Scrutatio in Albay, a form of Bible study and sharing session about how we encounter God through certain verses. And randomly, drinawing ako ni Zhai, my friend. As a sentimental person, of course it meant a lot to me. Ipapa-frame ko talaga 'to🥰🤩. That’s how my Sunday went, pagod ang eabab but my heart was full. Truly a day for the Lord. ✨</p>

        <p>A day of quizzes postponed and meaningful moments with faith.</p>
        <p class="post-full-caption">Supposedly may quiz kami today sa Web System pero wala, na-resched. Sayang, bawas na sana sa to-do list ko eh😭. So instead, I spent my day reviewing for Information Management. May quiz din bukas, Chapters 1–3 agad. Grabe, mas mahaba pa PPT kaysa sa pasensya ko. Tinry ko na rin tapusin yung iba kong pendings na parang never naman din nauubos. Every time may matapos ako, may bagong lilitaw. In the evening, we had dinner with my churchmates kasama sister ko after our Renewal of Faith Rites at St. Raphael Parish. It felt nice to end the day with something peaceful and meaningful after all the school stuffs. And of course naka-outfit nanaman akes. May pang-post nanaman sa IG HAHAHAHHA char. </p>

        <p>Just a normal day with a lot of reschedules huhu.</p>
        <p class="post-full-caption">Tuesday was supposed to be that productive day the kind where everything gets done and you finally cross major tasks off your to-do list. We were scheduled for our Lab Activity checking from 4–7 PM, and I was mentally ready to finish it and move on. But instead, we only had a lecture during our morning class, and the lab checking didn’t push through. So we spent the rest of the day in the library searching for a thesis study for our Lab Activity in Information Management. We were also waiting for the quiz in that subject, fully prepared to take it, but it got rescheduled too. As someone who loves reducing my to-do list, I can’t help but feel a little annoyed whenever quizzes get moved. I just want to finish everything already instead of letting tasks pile up for next week. Still, I ended the day with a witty little twist. Since tomorrow is a holiday, we’re planning to have a mini outing and squeeze in some swimming lessons before our PATHFIT swimming class officially starts. We’re just hoping the plan really pushes through because we believe that "pag biglaan, natutuloy".</p>

        <p>A day full of swimming, food, music, and friends. All that on a random wednesday!?!?!?</p>
        <p class="post-full-caption">Wednesday was something I was genuinely excited about because natuloy na talaga. We did a food sharing. We even had a few drinks, just enough to keep the vibes fun and chill. The highlight was learning how to swim with Mishli teaching us. It was harder than I expected, especially trying to catch my breathing properly, but it was so fun. In that moment, I realized we really shouldn’t spend all our time just studying. We also need days like this days for laughter and core memories. While others probably had their “home sweet home” kind of rest after, mine was the opposite, it was a super busy day ahead. As soon as I got home, I headed to band practice because we have an upcoming gig at a café somewhere in Camalig. After that, my OG beshiwaps planned a catch-up at Sawangan Park in the evening. As someone with many circles of friends, I feel like I need to see them all or else it’s all over HAHAHAHA. It was such a full day and by the end of it, I was extremely tired but very, very happy.</p>

        <p>Back to reality.</p>
        <p class="post-full-caption">Today felt unusually boring, maybe because all the happiness and energy were already spent yesterday. It’s funny how one day can be so full of fun and memories, and the next feels like a total reset back to reality. I was welcomed by a mountain of pending activities. Even though I just finished some tasks recently, new ones were sent again yesterday, so it feels like my to-do list just keeps regenerating. No matter how much I try to clear it, may bagong lalabas. Most of my day was spent working on our ERD for the lab activity, the same one we searched a thesis study for in the library the other day.</p>

        <p>A day filled with music preparation.</p>
        <p class="post-full-caption">Today was filled with music and exciting opportunities. Our band had an intense practice session to prepare for our upcoming gig, where we'll be performing until the café closes. We challenged ourselves to memorize **15 songs**, which is no easy feat, but we're all determined to deliver a great performance. On top of that, I was contacted by the president of the **BU Symbiosis** and invited to perform at **Bionights** on **March 27**. This sparked the idea to form a new band with my friends, and I’m really looking forward to this fresh start. Despite the pressure of practice, I’m feeling inspired and excited for the future, and I can’t wait to see where this musical journey takes me.</p>
