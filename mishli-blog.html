        <p>Sat class — had lunch with our Ethics professor; friends brought food and shared within our circle.</p>
        <p class="post-full-caption">Finally! Another exciting Saturday class where I got to dress up rather than attend online class on a daily basis because of our CS Building 2’s delay in construction.

My first time eating lunch in the CSSP campus and I guess what, we had our food sharing together with our friends and surprisingly, with our Ethics teacher, Ma’am Pauline! It was so fun, I got to taste the foods that were cooked by my friends!

This Saturday “Kanya-kanyang Baon Sharing” is like a culture we started. Looking forward to the next ones where I’ll be bringing my specialty too and offer it to my loved ones!

After class at 3 PM, we went to Ayala just to roam around and unwind a little. We ended up finding an art exhibit, which made the spontaneous trip even more special. We also bumped into some of our fellow friends and classmates, so it turned into a mini hangout outside campus. It was such a simple day, but truly one to remember. 💗

        <p>Attended and supported my friend Trinity’s Arts Month culminating activity.</p>
        <p class="post-full-caption"> My friend, Trinity, mentioned that she’ll be having a foundation event in their school and invited me. Little did I know that my inner child would be healed by just this experience.

There were lots of students who danced, may it be hip-hop, ballroom, or traditional dances. I took photos and videos of her and cheered her on. They won, and I’m so glad for the quest she accomplished.

After her play, we sat together while eating my small ponkans that I bought, luckily half price. We stayed there, listening to the solo singers, and just hearing the relaxing sound from the speakers truly blessed my ears.

What a wonderful experience! 💗

        <p>Continued painting our PathFit canvas, La Speranza.</p>
        <p class="post-full-caption">We started and finished our painting, “La Speranza,” translating to “Hope,” based on our chosen theme: Kulay ng Pag-asa: Buhay Estudyante sa Bicol University. As Group 3, we gathered our ideas and turned them into reality.

In the making of the painting, struggles happened. From deciding how to start, what colors to use, and where to keep the painting while it was still in progress, everything required patience and teamwork.

I’m very thankful for the collaboration of our team. From painting the base, sketching, filling the sketches with color, and doing the final retouches, each of us played an important role.

In the end, we made it. Congrats, team! 🎨✨</p>

        <p>Had Networking and Information Management classes; after, Shieanne and I rode Marley’s motorcycle out of campus — it was so fun.</p>
        <p class="post-full-caption">Just another normal day where we had our morning Networking class. Our professor discussed the lesson and called us to recite, which definitely kept us awake. After that, we ate lunch and prepared ourselves for the expected 1 PM quiz in Information Management 1. We waited for the Zoom link for the quiz, only to find out that it was cancelled. Talk about mixed emotions.

Since there was suddenly extra time, I went to Building 2 and met up with my friends. We continued brainstorming and trying to find a topic for my ERD in the same subject. It was productive, but still full of random chika in between.

Afterward, we went downstairs and eventually parted ways with the others. Marley, Shieanne, and I stayed behind as we waited for Marley to finish her treasurer duties. When she was done, we rode on her motorcycle, dropped Shieanne off near the Commencement Grounds, and I was dropped off near Gate 1.

Riding her motorcycle felt so fun and was such a great way to end the day. Thank you, Marley and Shieanne. Lovelots! 💗</p>

        <p>Went swimming with the group at Villa Aguilar. It was amazing and so much fun!</p>
        <p class="post-full-caption">Our friend group was feeling like we needed some time to spend for our well-being after all the accomplishments we did in relation to our acads. So, we planned our swimming bonding and actually made it come to life.

We brought food, shared laughter, and did the most ridiculous shenanigans that were all real and unfiltered. It was one of those days where everything just felt light and happy.

As someone who already has experience in swimming, I taught them the basics in preparation for our PathFit class. It felt so fulfilling seeing them learn and improve. I didn’t expect that teaching them would make me that proud.

We even filmed a TikTok video after, and the whole process of making it was so worth it. Looking forward to our next swimming bonding and PathFit practice, too. The best one, indeed.

Oh, and I still cannot forget how I was the only one wearing pink while they were all in black. I felt so betrayed. Just kidding. It was actually so cutesy that they all had black swimming tops.

Miss you all. See you next face-to-face classes. Love, love, love, loveee lots! 💗</p>

        <p>Played futsal at Bañadero and a special friend gave me a flower.</p>
        <p class="post-full-caption">Thursday was a day full of free time, so my friends and I went to Bañadero to play futsal. In the photos, you can see us doing goofy stuff and just enjoying the moment. It was one of those spontaneous days that turned into something really fun.

I played as the winger during the game. It was tough and tiring to keep running around to chase the ball, but being tired is part of the game. I really love staying active, with high hopes that my asthma will not be triggered.

Just before the day ended, my cherished friend Trinity gave an appreciation gift to me and her coach. I felt so loved today. Thank you. May we all reach the paths we desire. Padayon! 💗

        <p>A day of fulfillment with my loving friends, and the accomplishment tie dye shirts for PathFit and blog for Web Systems and Technologies. Grateful to Ma'am Jevah for guiding us well before we start the making of this activity.</p>
        <p class="post-full-caption">For the last entry of my blog, I woke up early and chose to be productive. I started by arranging my things in my boarding house since I had just recently come back. After that, I focused on finishing my part in our partnership for this activity. While coding, I also took time to organize my contacts and call some of my friends. Doing that made me feel lighter and joyful.

Around 1 PM, Miko reached out to make our PathFit tie-dye shirts, and I said yes. Before that, though, I told my friend Moira that I would be giving her something that would make her day. We met up and rode a jeep together going to Guinobatan. She was very grateful for the gift I gave her, and I truly appreciated how thankful she was. She deserves it.

Afterwards, I walked to the Albay Provincial Sports Complex where Miko and I agreed to make our partnered tie-dye shirts. I brought snacks, and he bought some for me too. As we worked on our shirts, we caught up with each other, talking about the little things and even the bigger things in life. We missed each other a lot since we had both been busy focusing on our own circles and academics.

By the end of the day, we finished our shirts. It felt fulfilling, especially since it was the only free time we had to accomplish it before the Wednesday deadline. Miko even waited with me until I was able to ride home, which I found very thoughtful. On the way, the bus conductor was so cheerful with his vibes and the other passengers, and that simple energy added brightness to my day.

I stopped by Jollibee to finalize this activity. All I can say is that it was a roller coaster ride of emotions and moments. I am thankful for the patience and understanding my partner gave me while conducting this blog. Leann, you are truly a gift God has given me. Wishing you well in life and to more accomplishments in the future. 💗</p>
